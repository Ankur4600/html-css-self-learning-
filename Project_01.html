    <!--create a page with heading ,paragraph,line breaks and separators-->
    <!--use an image with height 300 px which is a link to another page-->
    <!--also use bold,italic,underline,and strikethrough in one line and write third equation og motion using superscript and subscript-->

       <b>HTML</b> stands for <i><u>Hyper Text Markup Language.</u></i> It is used to create a web pages and applications.<br>This language is easily understandable by the user and also be modofiable. It is actually a Markup language,<br> hence it provides a flexible way for desigining the web pages along with the lest.<br><br>HTML filesis made up of different elements.<b>An element</b> is a collection of start tag, end tag,attributes and the text between them.

    <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2><hr>
    <p>
        <big><b>CSS</b></big> stand for<i><u> Cascading Style Sheets</u></i>. It is used to style and lay out web pages<br>
        For example:- to alter the font,color,size and spacing of your content,split it into multiple columns and add <br>
        animations and other decorative features

           <h2> <b>What are Newton‚Äôs Laws of Motion?</b></h2><br> An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and <br>in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force. The acceleration of an object depends on the <br>mass of the object and the amount of force applied. Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, <br>the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first. Sir Isaac Newton worked in many areas of mathematics <br>and physics. He developed the theories of gravitation in 1666 when he was only 23 years old.<br> In 1686, he presented his three laws of motion in the ‚ÄúPrincipia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis.‚Äù <br>By developing his three laws of motion, Newton revolutionized science. Newton‚Äôs laws together with Kepler‚Äôs<br> Laws explained why planets move in elliptical orbits rather than in circles.<br> Below is a short movie featuring Orville and Wilbur Wright and a discussion about how Newton‚Äôs Laws of Motion applied to the flight of their aircraft.

        <h2>Newton‚Äôs First Law: Inertia</h2><p>An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.<br>

        <p><h1>Newton‚Äôs Second Law:</h1> Force The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.<br>
            <p><u><big>formula:-</big>v<sup>2</sup>=u<sup>2</sup>+2as.</u></p></p>
       <p><h2>Newton‚Äôs Third Law:</h2> Action & Reaction Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.
